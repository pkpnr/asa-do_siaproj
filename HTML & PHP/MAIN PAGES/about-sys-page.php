			Asa-Do? (Cebuano: “Where, really?”) — A  Store/Business Establishment Locator
		</p>
		<p>
			This website is for finding establishments surrounding USTP in order to help newer students familiarize themselves with their new surroundings. The main focus of this website is to help students find their necceseties much easier than going around looking at each store/establishment to see if they have what they want. The website offers a variety of functions like search, filter, sort, and more in which you can explore.
		</p>
		<p>
			Prototype of this page was release in May 13, 2021. Though the alpha is stil yet to be discussed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The target for this website is for all the new comers to the USTP. Since most of them are not from the area, they will have a hard time navigating in the roads and alley ways, the location for certain establishements and items sold in ceratin stores.
